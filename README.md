# Face-Recognition-Smart_attendance

 Today's study in the field of designing and development of attendance applications of face recognition that will recognize and capture a face through the attendance application and notes down the entry and exit time according to office premises .
 The attendance application automatically locates the location of the person using geofencing under a metered area .The log feeds of the employee details is saved in a database for reference. 
 During the attendance, a person with or without spectacle or masks .
 The application works as an user friendly robust app .Our system includes convolutional neural network which is to find the pattern of the matched pair of our face uploaded in the application. 
 The attendance application mainly focuses on blockchain for log feeds which is the time noted when attendance is taken and data encryption as future progress in the application. 
 This system will encompass a large number of applications using face recognition.
 It will be a time saver and totally eliminates the chances for proxy attendance. 
 It will lead to a discipline in the current industry .


The proposed system mainly focusses on accuracy and data encryption. 
For accuracy of marking attendance, we have used CNN which is a neural network . 
CNN can recognize a person uniquely by investigating the texture patterns and shape of the personâ€™s face. 
Through face recognition models, the application identifies a person and saves the record. 
In recent years, face recognition from stationary and moving images has been an active and demanding research area in the field of image processing, pattern recognition and so on. 
Main objective is making capturing mobile app to capture the employees face and enter the entry and exit time in database after successful face recognition. 
We concentrate more on data encryption and have used a blockchain database .
Using blockchain we create immutable attendance records of the employees and we also use it as a decentralized database for the mobile app and integrating with flask request we create the log of attendance records on the blockchain, 
It keeps the data of the employee even more secure and private.
